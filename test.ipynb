       "\"a 25-year - old male patient presented to our ear , nose and throat clinic with a history of nausea , vomiting , headache , vertigo and weight loss of 5 kg over the preceding 3 months . \\n an enlarged cervical lymph node was detected at clinical examination . \\n lymph node biopsy showed nodular lymphocyte - predominant hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nlphl , nodular paragranuloma ) . because of the neurological symptoms a cerebral mri scan was performed and revealed an intense perivascular , bilateral , contrast - medium enhancing lesion of the temporal lobes suggestive of cerebral vasculitis . \\n cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased number of mononuclear cells , but there was no indication for neurotropic viral or bacterial infections . \\n eeg revealed a left temporal epileptic focus , and anti - epileptic therapy was initiated . \\n nlphl was treated with 2 cycles of abvd chemotherapy and 20 gy involved - field radiotherapy . \\n steroid therapy ( prednisone 100 mg q.d . ) for the presumed paraneoplastic neurological manifestation was started 1 week before chemotherapy and led to the rapid disappearance of complaints . \\n because of renewed onset of nausea and vertigo after 3 weeks of treatment with abvd chemotherapy and 4 weeks of treatment with steroids , a follow - up brain mri and eeg were performed and demonstrated complete disappearance of the  vasculitic changes without additional pathologic findings . \\n five months after therapy , the patient is without neurological symptoms and a pet - ct showed a complete remission . \\n this case is a unique example of paraneoplastic central nervous system ( cns ) involvement in a patient with newly diagnosed nlphl . \\n we present a review of the literature on paraneoplastic cns symptoms in hodgkin 's lymphoma .\""
